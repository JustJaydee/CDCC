# CDCC Cyber-Dick Cum Cannon 
Goal:
To build a realistic “smart” strap-on for AFAB wear that is compact, battery operated and easy to wear and use. 
The device should be “set and forget” automated with very little input required during use once “the desired program” is selected
The device should be spontaneous and randomized, but intuitive to the situation it’s being used in
To give the wearer a simulated penis orgasm which is as close to the real thing as possible, including ejaculation
To extend and exaggerate the duration, force and volume of ejaculation
Have a “CUM NOW” feature to ensure both participants can achieve simultaneous orgasm if desired
Be safe to use for both participants
 
Basic concept:
Normal harness. This should be an “add on” system for any existing harness. 
Normal off the shelf dildo that has a cum feature. There are already several brands, models and designs of “ejaculating dildo” on the market which use a tube to reservoir system. This should work with any existing ejaculating dildo.  
There's a vibrating clit bullet and vibrating egg (or eggs) to be inserted vaginally, anally or both. 
A refillable, easy to clean reservoir of at least 100cc will be used as the “cum reservoir. This reservoir should be isolated to the rest of the electronics for both safety and ease of refilling/cleaning. 
A small servo controlled pump or other mechanical device will be used to control the flow rate and pressure of ejaculation. 
Powersource: safe, reliable, rechargeable 18650 or similar Lithium battery
USBC compatible BMS to recharge the battery
Power regulation, device will most likely require several different voltages
Tactile UI panel on outer case
Every stroke is counted
There is a random number of strokes needed to "cum"
The faster or harder the wearer strokes, the faster, harder and more frequent the vibration feedback becomes.
Vibe frequency and intensity should be completely in tune with the strokes.
Eventually, a random stroke count within a predetermined threshold is reached and 2 events will trigger.
The first threshold [precum threshold] will trigger [precum event]
The second threshold [cum threshold] will trigger [cum event]


Cum event description:
Vibes start pulsating at full power, in sync to the ejaculation to simulate a  contraction like sensation. (egg-bullet-egg-bullet) wave pattern
Small pump starts pumping cum in spurts that match the contractions, ejaculate on clit bullet pulse part of wave, pause on egg vibe part of wave)
Cum tube runs through a heater mechanism on the way. 
Design constraints: 
Everything needs to be controlled by a single microcontroller. 
Microcontroller needs to be able to:
Sense when the wearer is thrusting
Keep count of thrusts
Sense how hard or fast the wearer is thrusting
Control pump 
Control vibes
Control/monitor heater
Safety concerns
Total system shutdown “panic button”
Thermal runaway 
Hygiene and sterilization 
Electronics protected from fluid ingress 
Practicality
Easy to use
Easy to wear
Lightweight
Small form factor
Versatility
Modular design
Able to use without ejaculation function
Able to use without all vibe eggs or bullet
